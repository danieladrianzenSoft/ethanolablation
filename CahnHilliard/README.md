# Spinodal-Decomposition

> MATLAB function used to generate and record Cahn-Hilliard spinodal decomposition models

## Usage

Simply call the function with the desired system constants and the model will be generated and recorded! This function also allows for the customization of model grid size (performance limited), frame/capture methods, colormap, video name, and many other paramters. Model and coefficient details can be found on the Wikipedia page <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahn%E2%80%93Hilliard_equation" target="_blank">**here**</a>. See spinodal_decomp.m for the full documentation and more examples.

## Examples 

The above sample was created with the following function call:
```MATLAB
spinodal_decomp(10,3,'CaptureMode','incremental','NumIterations',50000);
```

A wide variety of behavior and appearance can be generated by altering the constants and model paramters. The below sample was created from the following call:
```MATLAB
spinodal_decomp(10,10,...
                'CaptureMode','incremental',...
                'Colormap','jet',...
                'ImgStyle','true',...
                'NumIterations',25000);
```
